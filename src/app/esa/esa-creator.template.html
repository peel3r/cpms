  At the assessment
  You might have to wait some time before being seen â€“ delays are not uncommon.
  When the doctor is ready to see you, they will come to get you from the waiting area
  to take you into the examination room. This gives them a chance to watch how you
  manage to rise from a chair, walk and sit down again or how you manage with a
  wheelchair.<br><br>
  You may find it helpful to have someone with you at the assessment. This could be a
  relative, friend or support worker. They can help fill in any gaps in what you tell the
  doctor.<br><br>
  During the assessment, the doctor will identify the descriptors (listed in Section F of
  the Claiming ESA booklet) that they consider apply to you. To do this, they will ask
  questions about your daily activities (including hobbies or leisure activities). They will
  observe how you manage during the assessment itself and they may give you an
  examination.<br><br>
  When answering the doctor, explain your difficulties as fully as you can. You should
  tell them about any pain or exhaustion you feel, or would feel, while carrying out
  tasks, both on the day of the assessment and over time.<br><br>
  Consider how you would feel if you had to do the same task repeatedly. Try not to
  overestimate your ability to undertake tasks. Let them know what you are like on bad
  days, as well as good days.<br><br>
  Do not assume the doctor has a good understanding of your condition. They may not fully
  understand how you are affected by your condition unless you make it clear. They might
  make incorrect assumptions about your abilities unless you tell them otherwise. For
  example, they might not have seen you getting dropped off right outside the entrance
  of the examination centre and could assume you were able to walk from the bus
  stop.<br><br>
  If you find the assessment makes you tired or you are beginning to find it difficult to
  answer because of your condition symptoms, you need to tell the doctor this.

            The doctor will usually ask how you get around your home and whether it is all on
            the same level or if there are stairs you need to climb. If so, how do you manage with
            these?
            They will probably ask how you got to the examination centre. If you came by bus,
            they will want to know how far the bus stop is from your home and how you
            managed to get there (they will already know the distance between the examination
            centre and the nearest bus stop). Ensure you let them know about any rests you
            needed to take on the way, and how long you needed to rest each time.
            They may ask how you manage your shopping. For example, the DWP advises
            doctors that someone who can mobilise round a shopping centre or supermarket is
            unlikely to have their mobility limited to less than 800 metres. If you do go to the
            supermarket, let the doctor know if it is just a small local one, and if you have to stop
            several times to take a rest.

            With respect to standing, the doctor may ask whether you do the washing up or
            cooking, and how you manage to stand when doing so. They will probably ask how
            you manage with queues in shops or while waiting for public transport. From your
            answers, they will gain an impression of your limitations in standing.
            Similarly, with respect to sitting, the doctor will usually ask if you watch much TV and
            whether you could sit through a 30-minute news programme or an hour-long wildlife
            documentary. The doctor may ask how you manage sitting in other circumstances,
            such as using a computer, going to a pub, sitting at mealtimes or travelling in cars or
            buses. Of course, the doctor will be able to see how you are managing throughout
            the assessment. Do not be afraid to ask the doctor if you can get up and walk around
            (or lie down) if you are in pain or discomfort.
            If you stated on the questionnaire that you had problems transferring from a
            wheelchair, the doctor may ask how you manage with similar activities, such as
            getting on and off the toilet or getting in and out of a car.

            bottles. They could ask about your hobbies or leisure activities; whether you read

            shopping, reading, cooking, bathing or caring for children â€“ in each case to get a
            wider view of your visual problems. They could ask about any falls or accidents you
            have had.
            The doctor will be able to observe you getting round the examination room and might
            check if you can read any medication labels you have brought in. They may ask you
            to do a visual field test.
